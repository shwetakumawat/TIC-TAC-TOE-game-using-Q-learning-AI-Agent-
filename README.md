# TIC-TAC-TOE-game-using-Q-learning-AI-Agent-
An AI agent learns to play tic-tac-toe - Where we use Q learning to train a reinforcement learning agent to play tic-tac-toe, we built the opponent for our reinforcement learning (RL) agent, The goal of the agent is to find an efficient policy, i.e. what action is optimal in a given situation. In the case of tic-tac-toe this means what move is optimal given the state on the board. Notice that the policy focuses on long-term value Q, not soley on short term reward R. More mathematically speaking, the policy is the function 𝑄(𝑆,𝑎) with state 𝑠 and action 𝑎, and reinforcement learning is the way to learn this function.
